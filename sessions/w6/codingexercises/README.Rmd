## Writing Functions

#### Q1: Functions with Arguments

Write a function to pass the radius and calculate circular area
+ Note:
    + Area of circle = pi * r * r
    + ```pi``` is a default variable in R


#### Q2: Passing Multiple Arguments

Using the ```euro.cross``` dataset, do the following

a. Create a function to take in 2 currencies and print exchange rate
b. What happens when you reverse the order of function arguments?
c. What happens when you pass named arguments to the function?

---

## Control Statements: Using ```for``` loops, ```while``` loops, ```ifelse```

#### Q3: Create a numeric vector of length 10. Pass it into a function to calculate and print the cumulative sum at each iteration.


#### Q4: Set variable i = 1. While i is less than 10, print the value of i.

__Very important__: When using loops, you need to iterate (increase the value of) the looping variable (in this case, i) . Failure to do so leads to what is called an ```INFINITE``` loop, which will break your programming flow.

#### Q5: Write a function to take an input of 10 random numbers. If a number is below 0.5, set it to 0, else to 1.

## Group Manipulation: ```apply``` family

#### Q6: Generate a 6x5 matrix using rnorm


a. Calculate row means using ```apply``` / ```rowMeans```

b. Calculate column means using ```apply``` / ```colMeans```

c. Calculate ```rowSums``` and ```colSums```

#### Q7: Use ```mtcars``` dataset


a. Return a list of column variances

b. Return a vector of column variances

#### Q8: Create this dataset and return maximum batting average by team

```{r results="hide"}
baseball.data <- data.frame(
                            team = gl(5, 5,
                            labels = paste("Team", LETTERS[1:5])),
                            player = sample(letters, 25),
                            batting.average = runif(25, .200, .400))
```
